        <h2>Musical style</h2>
        <p>Mick Karn was essentially a self-taught musician. His first musical instrument was bassoon, with which he attended and passed an LSSO audition. After his bassoon was stolen from him by skinheads, he purchased a bass guitar for &pound;5. It was then he joined up with David Sylvian, who played acoustic guitar.</p>
        <p>Karn's use of the fretless bass produces a distinctive sound and playing style, which makes his playing immediately recognisable. He was principally the bassist within Japan, but also played all the wind instruments; on Tin Drum, he played the Chinese suona.</p>
        <p>Karn played a Travis Bean bass on all Japan albums up to Gentlemen Take Polaroids. In 1981 he moved to Wal basses. Karn recorded Japan's last studio album Tin Drum with a Wal and had continued to use these for his solo albums.</p>
